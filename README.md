# Energy-Consumption-Prediction-Analysis

## **Project Overview**  
This project analyzes energy consumption patterns for residential properties served by eSC, an energy provider in South Carolina. The objective is to predict energy usage during peak summer months, assess the impact of climate change, and identify key factors driving energy demand. The project employs **data analytics, machine learning models, and interactive visualizations** to provide insights into optimizing energy efficiency and mitigating blackout risks.  

## **Key Objectives**  
- **Predict energy consumption** if summer temperatures rise by 5 degrees.  
- Identify **top factors influencing energy usage** across different house sizes and counties.  
- Provide **actionable recommendations** for managing peak demand and promoting energy efficiency.  

## **Data Sources**  
- **Static House Data:** Details of ~5,000 single-family houses, including building attributes.  
- **Energy Usage Data:** Hourly consumption records for each house, categorized by appliances.  
- **Weather Data:** Hourly temperature and humidity data across 50 counties.  

## **Methodology**  
1. **Data Preparation:** Merging house, energy usage, and weather datasets for July analysis.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing energy usage trends, weather correlations, and consumption drivers.  
3. **Weather Simulation:** Increasing July temperatures by 5 degrees to assess future energy demand.  
4. **Model Building:** Training **Linear Regression and Decision Tree models**, selecting the best-performing model using RMSE.  
5. **Shiny App Development:** Creating an interactive dashboard for users to explore predictions and insights.  

## **Results & Insights**  
- **Key drivers of energy consumption** include house size, temperature, and appliance usage patterns.  
- **Predictive modeling** helps forecast future energy needs with **high accuracy**, aiding proactive grid management.  
- **Shiny App visualization** enables stakeholders to interact with energy consumption scenarios dynamically.  

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Python, R, and R-Studio** for data processing and modeling.  
- **Machine Learning** (Linear Regression, Decision Trees) for predictive analysis.  
- **Shiny App** for interactive energy consumption visualization.  

## **Conclusion**  
The project provides **data-driven recommendations** for eSC to enhance **grid reliability, reduce peak loads, and encourage energy-saving behaviors** among consumers. The insights help mitigate risks associated with **climate change and rising energy demands**.
